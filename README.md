# Bike-lights
This is a personal project to install turn signals on bicycles. 

The project was developed for Arduino with a total hardware cost of about â‚¬ 60, for budget needs it is possible to use Arduino Nano at a lower cost, Source Amazon.com. 

The hardware components are: 
- Arduino / Arduino nano
- Rocker switch ON-OFF-ON 5A
- 4 Adafruit led strips with 3 connectors (DIN, 5V, GND) (Variable length) 
- Bread Board (variable size)
- Connection cables

The wiring diagram is described in the "Circuit.png" file, which uses two ON-OFF switches. 

I hope this little project can save some people from traffic accidents.
